/**
 * @NOTE : WHY NOT USING GMAIL? 
 * Even though Gmail is the fastest way to get started with sending emails, it is by no means a preferable
 *  solution unless you are using OAuth2 authentication. Gmail expects the user to be an actual user not a
 *  robot so it runs a lot of heuristics for every login attempt and blocks anything that looks suspicious to
 *  defend the user from account hijacking attempts. For example you might run into trouble if your server is
 *  in another geographical location â€“ everything works in your dev machine but messages are blocked in 
 * production.

/**
 * @TODO Have to make publisher and subscriber for email thing. This code will just publish o rabbit mq
 * whereas the subscribber (Which ive to write) will Subscribe it and shoot email. Check below to understand task
 * 
 *  @TODO As example, check this github project https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer-amqp-example
 *  This is an example of using RabbitMQ (amqplib) for queueing Nodemailer email messages. This allows you to push messages from your application quickly to 
 *  delivery queue and let Nodemailer handle the actual sending asynchronously from a background process.
