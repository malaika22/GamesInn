/**
 * @NOTE : WHY NOT USING GMAIL? 
 * Even though Gmail is the fastest way to get started with sending emails, it is by no means a preferable
 *  solution unless you are using OAuth2 authentication. Gmail expects the user to be an actual user not a
 *  robot so it runs a lot of heuristics for every login attempt and blocks anything that looks suspicious to
 *  defend the user from account hijacking attempts. For example you might run into trouble if your server is
 *  in another geographical location â€“ everything works in your dev machine but messages are blocked in 
 * production.
